## [Pathfinding Game](https://flipcomputing.github.io/a-level-resources/pathfinding.html)

The goal of this game is to find the shortest path between two nodes of a graph. The starting node is shown in the orange, and the target node is shown in purple. You can choose your path by walking to the orange node to highlight it, and then walk to each node on your chosen path in order, until you reach the purple node.

This project is intended to be used to show students an example use of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Initially, the user tries to find the shortest path themselves, but when they have finished their path, they are shown the actual shortest path, as calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm, and are shown the weights assigned to each node by the algorithm.

At the start of the lesson the students could be told the task, i.e. finding the shortest path from the orange node to the purple node. Then they could be asked to generate their own ideas on how to work out the shortest path. After this, the program will show them the solution, which it calculates using Dijkstra's algorithm, and then the students can be taught how Dijkstra's algorithm works and found the shortest path.
